In these exercises, you are only defining functions, each of which is supposed to return something. The main.py file takes care of any user inputs and printing onto the console.

Meaning: YOU SHOULD NOT BE USING THE KEYWORDS input OR print ANYWHERE IN part1, part2, part3, or part4.

The keyword return should appear in your function definitions.
